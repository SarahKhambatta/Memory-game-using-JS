How to Play
Start the Game: Press the "Start" button.
Watch the Sequence: The game will highlight a series of colors in a specific order.
Repeat the Sequence: Click the colors in the same order as displayed.
Level Up: Each correct sequence adds one more color to the sequence.
Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the game.
CSS3: Styling for colors, animations, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Game logic, event handling, and dynamic updates.
How It Works
Game Initialization: The game generates a random sequence of colors and waits for player input.
User Input Handling: Listens for clicks on color buttons and compares the input to the generated sequence.
Feedback: Provides audio and visual cues for correct and incorrect inputs.
Game Progression: Adds a new color to the sequence after each successful level.
Example Code Snippet
Here’s a snippet of the color sequence generation logic in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
const colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"];
let sequence = [];

function generateSequence() {
    const randomColor = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];
    sequence.push(randomColor);
    playSequence();
}

function playSequence() {
    sequence.forEach((color, index) => {
        setTimeout(() => highlightColor(color), index * 1000);
    });
}
